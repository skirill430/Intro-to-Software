# Quick Shop

## Description
Tasked with developing a full stack web application using Golang and Angular, our team developed a shopping website that connects to multiple online store APIs to allow users to see a wide range of products in one place. Enter a desired item and generate a table of results from both Target and Walmart that can be filtered by name, price, and rating. For further functionality, create an account to save or remove products to a viewable list of products.
